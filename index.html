                <p>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) was a German polymath. He is regarded as one of the most important figures in human history due to his contributions in mathematics, philosophy, religion, pshysics, engeneering, politcs, law and much more.</p>
                <p>His discoveries and inventions are widely used to this day, like the process of integration and derivation in calculus and the development of the binary code of zeros and ones used on our computers. He wrote important papers on Philosophy and Philosophy of Religion that influenced our way of thinking about the world and God's influence in our lives.</p>
                <p>Some people are destined to greatness and Leibniz's vast knwoledge and deep understanding of world are rivaled by few throughout human history.</p>

                <h2>Here you can see a brief time line of Leibniz's life:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="timeline-date">1646: </span>Leibniz is born in the city of Leipzig, Holy Roman Empire, current Germany.</li>
                    <li><span class="timeline-date">1658: </span>At the age of 12 he becomes proficient in Latin.</li>
                    <li><span class="timeline-date">1661: </span>At the age of just 14 Leibniz enters the Leipzig University, the same university father attended to.</li>
                    <li><span class="timeline-date">1666: </span>He writes his first book called "On the Combinatorial Art" as part of his gradiation thesys.</li>
                    <li><span class="timeline-date">1673: </span>He is made External Member of the Royal Society by showing a mechanical calculator that is capable of doing all four fundamental operations.</li>
                    <li><span class="timeline-date">1675: </span>He develops calculus independentely of Isaac Newton. Later, this would spark a heated debate in the academic community to determine if their discovery was, in fact, independent of one another.</li>
                    <li><span class="timeline-date">1684: </span>Leibniz first publishies his finds on Calculus, before Sir Isaac Newton.</li>

                    <li><span class="timeline-date">1689: </span>Leibniz creates the binary code composed of combination of ones and zeros. The same code its used today, on our computers and machines to store and manipulate data.</li>
                    <li><span class="timeline-date">1708: </span>The "calculus priority dispute" begins as both Newton and Leibniz claim to be the sole author of calculus theory. To this day, the Leibniz's notation is used in detriment of Newton's own notation.</li>
